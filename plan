Things to do in no particular order:

Create the project files
	-Create all the necessary .c and .h files even if empty
	-Copy and adjust the makefile for this project
	
Create the menu
	-it could either be a function that accepts parameters returned by input functions or part of main
	-regardless of the implementation it seems like a prime candidate for a switch statement
	-no actions yet, just have a directory
	
Write functions for accepting input
	-user will input the following information
		-menu option choice (it might only be this, seems like the menu will handle all input)
		
Create a rentalProperty struct type
	-it will have the members
		-street name(pointer to a street struct, randomly selected)
		-street number( 1-200 randomly generated)
		-price per bedroom ( 200-600 in increments of 50)
		-number of bedrooms ( 1-4 random )
		
Create a street struct type
	-Members
		-name
		-base distance from campus ( 0.5-4km in 100m increments randomly generated 100*random(5, 40) )
		

Create a static array of 10 different streets
	-use {} initialization to create the array then assign everything a random distance
	
Write a function to calculate the distance from the college
	-accepts a pointer to a rental property as an argument
	-returns a number of meters calculated by street distance + number*20
	
Write the following functions for linked list management
	-count the number of items in a list
		int getCount( Node *pHead )
	-find the i-th element in a list
		Node getNodeAtIndex ( Node *pHead, int i )
	-Append an item to the end of a list
		void appendNode( Node **ppHead,
